% This package is devoted to help writing exercises along with their
% solutions in a single document. 
%
% Simply add
%    \usepackage[solexo]
% This package accepts two options:
%   - nosol which means that the solutions are not included in the output
%   file
%   - separate to indicate that the solutions should be printed outside of
%   the exercise text. The created document will actually contain two
%   parts: first, the exercises and then their solutions.
%
% Without any options the solution to a question is put right behind the
% question text and ends with a black triangle at the end of the line. When
% the solution to a question ends with a dispalyed equation, we may need to
% add \endhere at the end of the equation to make sure the black triangle
% is not displayed on a separate line.
%
% Here is a typical usage
%
% \begin{exo}[optional title]
% Some introducive text.
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Question 1.
%     \solution{Solution to the previous question.}
%   \item Question 2.
%     \solution{Solution to the previous question.}
% \end{enumerate}
% Add some extra gobal information if any
% \begin{enumerate}[resume] 
% %% include the enumitem package to use the resume option
%   \item Question 3.
%     \solution{Solution to the previous question.}
%   \item Question 4.
%     \solution{Solution to the previous question.}
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{exo}
